# The Arduino Sunflower Project

The Arduino Sunflower Project is a simple project that uses an Arduino UNO R3, an LDR and a servo to raise and lower a sunflower when the light turns on and off. The servo is connected to a sunflower (built with chopsticks, construction paper and tape). The project will require wall or USB power. We started with batteries, but found that the LDR used them up overnight. This is a good project if you are looking for something simple that can be done with a toddler (could be a few weekends of fun).
