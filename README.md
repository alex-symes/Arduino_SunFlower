# The Arduino Sunflower Project

The Arduino Sunflower Project is a simple project that uses an Arduino UNO R3, an LDR and a servo to raise and lower a sunflower when the light turns on and off. The servo is connected to a sunflower (built with chopsticks, construction paper and tape). This is a good project if you are looking for something simple that can be done with a toddler.
